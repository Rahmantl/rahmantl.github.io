Hi! I am Rahman, a junior researcher in Mathematics. I recently completed my Master of Science in Mathematics at the Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi-Civita” of the University of Padova, where I focused on the theoretical foundations of modern learning algorithms.

As an Erasmus researcher in the Chair for Machine Learning at Ruhr University Bochum, I conducted my master’s thesis, “On the Computation of Relative Flatness in Convolutional Layers,” under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Kamp and Dr. Linara Adilova, in close collaboration with the research group of Prof. Dr. Asja Fischer.

My academic path began at the University of Guilan in Iran, where I obtained both my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Its Applications and a first Master of Science in Applied Mathematics (Optimization), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Maziar Salahi. During this period, I worked on matrix completion problems using convex optimization methods.

As a mathematics researcher, I am particularly motivated by real-world problems and by developing efficient, theoretically grounded methods for solving complex systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, deep learning theory, and statistics.
