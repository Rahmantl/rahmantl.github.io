I am **Rahman**, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Mathematics from the **University of Padova** (Italy).
I conducted my Master's thesis at **Ruhr University Bochum** in the Chair of Machine Learning (Lab of Prof. Dr. Asja Fischer). 


My academic interests lie at the intersection of Mathematics and Machine Learning.
