I am **Rahman Taleghani**, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Mathematics from the **University of Padova** (Italy).

I conducted my Master's thesis at **Ruhr University Bochum** in the Chair of Machine Learning (Lab of Prof. Dr. Asja Fischer). My research was conducted under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Michael Kamp** (now at Lammar, TU Dortmund) and **Dr. Linara Adilova** (now at TU Dortmund).

My academic interests lie at the intersection of Mathematics and Machine Learning.
