I am **Rahman **, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Mathematics from the **University of Padova** (Italy).

I conducted my Master's thesis at **Ruhr University Bochum** in the Chair of Machine Learning (Lab of Prof. Dr. Asja Fischer). My research was conducted under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Michael Kamp** (now at Lammar, TU Dortmund) and **Dr. Linara Adilova** (now at TU Dortmund).
My research focuses on understanding the relationship between flatness and generalization in deep learning. My work aims to develop efficient methods that enhance model robustness while maintaining high accuracy. With a background in mathematics, particularly in optimization and modeling, I am deeply engaged in exploring both the theoretical and applied aspects of deep learning.
My academic interests lie at the intersection of Mathematics and Machine Learning.
